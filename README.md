# Telescope-Beam-Forming
This notebook simulates beamforming for a telescope array to enhance observations from celestial sources. Using 3D telescope positions and signal alignment, the technique amplifies signals arriving from a specific direction. The code demonstrates delay-and-sum beamforming, visualizing telescope signals, array configuration, and the beamformed result.
